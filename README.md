### Pinetree Outbreak Script

The **Pinetree Outbreak Script** is a comprehensive analysis tool for the TradingView platform. Its main goal is to provide investors with well-founded **decision-making support** by combining various analysis approaches into a single dashboard.

Here are the main goals explained simply for beginners:

### 1. The Combination of Fundamental Data and Technical Analysis

The most important goal of the script is to not only look at the stock price but also the company's **economic health**. A technical buy signal (e.g., a price increase) is only considered a valid entry signal if the fundamental data (such as profit and cash flow) also align.

### 2. A 9-Point Warning System for Fundamental Risks

The script monitors nine critical warning signs in real-time to protect the user from risky investments. These include, among others:
*   **Share Dilution:** If the company issues too many new shares.
*   **High Debt:** If debt is too high compared to cash flow.
*   **Declining Margins:** If sales are increasing, but profit cannot keep up.
Based on these and other criteria, the script assigns a **"Fundamental Grade" from A+ to F**, allowing you to immediately assess the quality of a stock.

### 3. Identifying Optimal Entry Points (Breakouts)

The script uses the well-known **CAN SLIM strategy** to look for "breakouts." An entry signal is only generated when several conditions are met simultaneously, such as:
*   The price breaks above an old high.
*   Trading volume is significantly increased (indicating purchases by large institutions).
*   The trend is positive in both the short and long term.

### 4. Future Forecasts and Probabilities

Instead of just looking at the past, the script attempts to mathematically model the future:
*   **Price Forecast:** Based on free cash flow (FCF), it calculates three possible price targets for the next year (bear, base, and bull scenarios).
*   **Probability Calculator:** It estimates the likelihood of a buy signal or a warning occurring within the next 5 days.

### 5. Market Calendar and Sector Rotation

Another goal is to identify which phase the economy is currently in (e.g., recovery or recession). The script indicates whether the sector of the chosen stock (e.g., technology or energy) is currently **"favored"** in the current market environment or if "smart money" (institutions) is already shifting to other sectors.

### Important Note for Beginners

The script is **not a trading robot**. It does not execute automatic purchases or sales. Its purpose is to clearly present all relevant information – from the balance sheet to the chart – so that you, as an investor, can make a more informed decision.

**In summary:** The goal is to separate the wheat from the chaff by filtering only stocks with strong fundamental data and positive technical momentum.
