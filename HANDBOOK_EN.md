## 1. Philosophy: The Symbiosis of Alpha Factors
Master Guard V15 recognizes: In the short term, stock prices are influenced by psychology (technical analysis); in the long term, they follow fundamental data (cash flows).

V15 is an **expert system** – it simulates an analyst team:
- **Macro Analyst:** Sector Rotation
- **Balance Sheet Analyst:** Cash flows & Debt
- **Mathematician:** Volatility probabilities
- **Chart Technician:** Trends & Entry points

**Pro Tip:** Think like a professional – risk first, opportunity second.

---

## 2. Sector Rotation: The Core (Macro Overlay)
The most common mistake: Good stock, wrong sector. V15 measures global money flow with the Rotation Module.

### Sector Score (ScorePhases)
Comparison of six sector ETFs (XLK, XLF, XLV, XLE, XLP, XLU) over:
1. **Long-term (60 days):** Structural phase
2. **Short-term (20 days):** Fast rotations (Smart Money)

**Phase Logic:**
- **Early Recovery:** Financials beat Tech – Start of the bull market
- **Mid Expansion:** Tech leads – Highest profits
- **Late Expansion:** Energy & Materials rise – Cycle end is nearing
- **Defensive:** Only Utilities & Staples win – Market is risky

**Sector Fit:** The tool recognizes the sector of your stock (`syminfo.sector`). Warning if there is a lack of tailwind.

**Pro Tip:** Only buy stocks with sector tailwinds.

---

## 3. Valuation Models: Dynamic & Multi-Factorial
In the past: Only Free Cash Flow (FCF). Now: Model selection based on the business model.

### A. Book Value Model (Banks/Finance)
Banks: No classic FCF – therefore **P/B** (Price-to-Book ratio). Focus: **Equity CAGR**.

### B. Earnings Model (Utilities)
Utilities: Often have negative cash flows due to heavy investments. V15 uses **P/E (Price-to-Earnings)** on TTM earnings.

### C. Sales Model (Unprofitable Growth)
Young companies without profit: **P/S (Price-to-Sales)**. Revenue growth as a survival factor.

**Pro Tip:** Check the valuation model – does it fit the business model?

---

## 4. Fundamental Metrics & CAGR Logic
V15 uses a 5-year regression (Y0 to Y4).

### CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)
Intelligent fallback logic:
- 4 years of data → 4Y CAGR
- 1 year → YOY comparison
- **Turnaround:** From loss to profit → marked as "TURNAROUND" (100% growth)

### FCF Run-Rate (Cyclical Boost)
Massive upswing detected if quarterly cash flow (`FQ * 4`) is > 75% above the previous year. V15 then uses the Run-Rate – ideal for cyclical stocks.

**Pro Tip:** Identify cyclical booms early – use the Run-Rate!

---

## 5. Algorithmic Price Forecasting (Smart Forecast)
V15 calculates a **Fair Value** for the next 12 months – no static lines.

### Growth Damping (Decay Growth)
Mathematical damping:
- Growth > 50% → damped to 35% + remainder
- Growth > 20% → halved
This creates realistic price targets.

### Multiple Normalization
Extremely high multiples (e.g., P/FCF 200x) are regressed to the mean. Forecast is based on a normalized multiple.

**Pro Tip:** Always check price targets with growth damping and multiple normalization.

---

## 6. Technical Market Analysis & Probability
Combination of classic indicators and modern statistics.

### Probability Calculation (Prob. Entry/Warning)
V15 uses log returns & standard deviations:
1. **Log Return:** Daily percentage change
2. **Expected Move:** Statistically probable movement (5 days)
3. **Prob. Entry:** Probability of breaking the 50-day high
4. **Prob. Warning:** Probability of falling below the SMA 50

### Weekly Filter (Trend Protection)
Entry signal only valid if the 10-week average > 40-week average (SMA 50/200 on a weekly basis).

**Pro Tip:** Always check the weekly chart – the daily chart alone is not enough!

---

## 7. 9-Point Warning System (Risk Guard)
The system scans for 9 specific risks:

1. **DILUTION:** Share count increases >5% → Dilution
2. **NEGATIVE METRIC:** Cash flow/Book value negative → Insolvency risk
3. **OVERVALUED:** Multiple exceeds historical limit (e.g., >60)
4. **FUNDAMENTALS ↓↓:** Growth rates are falling
5. **MARGIN SQUEEZE:** Revenue rising, profit falling
6. **REV DECLINE:** Core business is shrinking
7. **DEBT HEAVY:** Debt > 10x FCF
8. **DETERIORATION:** Equity is deteriorating
9. **VALUATION SHOCK:** Price massively above Bull Target

**Pro Tip:** More than 3 warnings = High Alert!

---

## 8. Dashboard: All Cells in Detail
The dashboard at the top right is your command center.

- **⚠ WARNINGS:** Number of flags – 0 = Perfect, >3 = Alert
- **FUND. GRADE:** A+ (Elite) to F (Junk) – based on profitability & CAGR
- **GAAP PROFIT:** Net income according to accounting rules
- **FCF/BOOK TREND:** Growth of the core metric
- **FORECAST BASIS:** Growth rate used for forecast lines
- **RS vs. BENCHMARK:** Comparison with the world market (URTH) – only buy "STRONGER"!
- **STOP / R:R:** ATR-based stop-loss & Risk-to-Reward ratio (>2.0)

**Pro Tip:** Always check the dashboard before making a purchase decision.

---

## 9. Risk Management & Position Sizing
V15 protects against excessive risk.

### Dynamic Stop-Loss
Two factors:
1. **ATR (Average True Range):** Stop 2 ATR below the price
2. **Base Low:** Low of the last 50 days
Automatic selection of the safer value.

### R:R Ratio (Risk-to-Reward)
Signal only turns green if the potential is at least twice as high as the risk to the stop-loss.

**Pro Tip:** R:R Ratio > 2 – otherwise, no entry!

## 10. Case Studies

This is an excellent example chart! NVIDIA (NVDA) perfectly demonstrates how the **V15 logic** handles extreme growth figures and market developments.

### 📈 Subsection 10.1: NVIDIA – The Giant at the Peak
**(Case Study: Growth Damping & Cyclical Overheating)**

NVIDIA is the prime example of a company that looks fundamental "perfect," but where the system urges caution because trees don't grow to the sky.

1.  **Fundamental Excellence (FUND. GRADE: A+):** The dashboard shows a straight **A+ (5/5)** grade.
    *   **Why?** Revenue growth of **+48.4%** and an FCF (Free Cash Flow) trend of **+65.4%** over 4 years are absolute elite values.
    *   **GAAP PROFIT:** With nearly **$100 billion** in profit (99,198M), the company is a highly profitable cash machine.
2.  **Warning of "Cyclical Boom" (🔥 PHASE):** Despite the top grade, the **PHASE** field glows orange: **"🔥 CYCLICAL BOOM (FCF CAGR 65.4%)"**.
    *   **The V15 Logic:** The system recognizes that FCF growth of 65% is mathematically unsustainable in the long term. It marks this as a "cyclical boom."
3.  **Price Forecast & Growth Damping (FORECAST):** Look closely at the **FORECAST (P/FCF)** line. It says: **"+27.2% (CYCL DECAY) | NORM 44.9x"**.
    *   **CYCL DECAY:** Even though the company grew by 65%, V15 only uses a damped growth rate of +27.2% for the future.
    *   **The Result:** The yellow line (**1Y FAIR**) is at **$181.49**. Since the current price is around **$189.93**, the tool signals: **The stock is currently slightly overvalued (-4.4% to Fair Value).**
4.  **The Technical Dilemma (PROB. WARNING vs. ENTRY):**
    *   **PROB. ENTRY (5d): 100%** -> Statistically, an upward breakout is almost certain.
    *   **PROB. WARNING (5d): 99.36%** -> Simultaneously, a pullback to the MA50 is almost equally certain.
    *   **ADX (TREND): 10.3 CHOPPY** -> Low ADX means no clear trend; the stock is "jittering" sideways.
5.  **Sector Rotation:**
    *   **CYCLE PHASE: LATE EXPANSION** -> We are in the late cycle.
    *   **SECTOR FIT: OUT OF FAVOR** -> Even though NVIDIA is "Stronger" than the market, the sector is not currently favored by "Smart Money."

### 📈 Subsection 10.2: JPMorgan – The Bank Model (P/B)
**(Case Study: Book Value Valuation & Valuation Gravity)**

JPMorgan shows us how Master Guard V15 automatically changes strategy for financial institutions.

1.  **Automatic Model Switch (Model: BOOK):** The system recognizes the "Finance" sector and immediately switches from the FCF model to the **Price-to-Book (P/B)** ratio.
2.  **Warning: Massive Overvaluation (1Y FAIR):**
    *   **P/B (NOW): 2.3x** vs. **NORM 1.6x**.
    *   **1Y FAIR:** $233.78. Current price: $308.67.
    *   **Verdict:** You are buying at the absolute historical limit.
3.  **Technical Decay (TREND: BEARISH):** The SMA 50 has been broken to the downside. The **PROB. WARNING** is 100%.
4.  **R:R Paradox:** The R:R might look green because the stop is close, but the **Master Guard Rule** states: Never enter if the trend is BEARISH and the price is massively above the 1Y FAIR value.

---

### 📈 Subsection 10.3: NextEra Energy – The Utility Model (P/E)
**(Case Study: Regulated Growth & "Smart Money" Rotation)**

1.  **Specialized Earnings Model (Model: EARNINGS):** V15 uses **P/E (KGV)** because utilities have high CapEx that distorts FCF. Growth is capped at 10-12% due to regulation.
2.  **Smart Money Rotation:** **SECTOR FIT: SMART MONEY (Utilities)** is a massive buy signal. In the late cycle, money flees to safe havens.
3.  **Warning: P/E > 25:** A P/E of 28 is historically high for a utility (**NORM 21.5x**). The stock is rising due to rotation but is fundamentally too expensive.
4.  **Strong Momentum:** ADX of 41.1 shows an extremely powerful trend. However, the R:R is red because the price is too far from the stop.

---

### 📈 Subsection 10.4: Amazon – The Investment Dilemma
**(Case Study: FCF Erosion through CapEx & the Valuation Vacuum)**

1.  **Fundamental Warning (1/9: FUNDAMENTALS ↓↓):** FCF trend is **-38%** while revenue grows. This is due to massive AI and logistics spending.
2.  **Forecast Shock:** Because the FCF trend is negative, the mathematical formula projects this forward. **1Y FAIR: $129.97** (Current: ~$209). V15 is extremely conservative here.
3.  **Technical Rebound:** Despite bad fundamentals, R:R is green (1:2.9) because the stock is "oversold" (RSI 38.5). This is a **technical rebound trade**, not a long-term investment signal.

---

### 📈 Subsection 10.5: Noble Corp – The Cycle Trap
**(Case Study: 🔥 CYCLICAL BOOM & the Rubber Band Effect)**

1.  **Cyclical Boom:** FCF Trend is **+59.4%**. V15 marks this as a boom, meaning: "Don't expect this to last forever."
2.  **The Rubber Band:** **DIST. TO MA200: 50.77%**. The price is stretched too far from its long-term average. The "rubber band" usually snaps back.
3.  **Volume Warning:** **VOLUME: DISTRIBUTION (Red)**. Big institutions are starting to sell their gains to retail investors.

---

### 📈 Subsection 10.6: Rivian – The Growth Model (P/S)
**(Case Study: Unprofitable Firms & Valuation via Sales)**

1.  **Model: SALES:** Since there are no profits, V15 uses the **Price-to-Sales (P/S)** ratio.
2.  **Grade C:** V15 is a "Guard." No profits = High risk. Only profitable firms get an "A."
3.  **Macro Headwind:** **OUT OF FAVOR**. In the late cycle, Smart Money avoids unprofitable growth stocks. Fundamental undervaluation is useless without momentum.

---

### 📈 Subsection 10.7: Plug Power – The Capital Destruction Machine
**(Case Study: Grade F & The Warning Light Storm)**

1.  **Grade F (0/5):** The company fails every quality check. It burns billions without earning a cent.
2.  **The Death Quartet:** **DILUTION**, **NEGATIVE METRIC**, **DEBT HEAVY**, **FUNDAMENTALS ↓↓**.
3.  **Dilution:** The company prints shares to pay debt, destroying shareholder value. **STRICT BUY BAN**.

---

### 📈 Subsection 10.8: ASML – The "Lumpy" Monopoly
**(Case Study: Irregular Cash Flows & MA200 Stretch)**

1.  **Auto-Lumpy Logic:** V15 knows ASML sells multi-million dollar machines irregularly. It suppresses "declining fundamentals" warnings because the volatility is inherent to the business model.
2.  **Fair Value Precision:** Currently perfectly valued ($1,499 vs $1,476).
3.  **Entry Risk:** **DIST. TO MA200: 53.67%**. Mathematically, you risk $5 to win $1. No new buy.

---

### 📈 Subsection 10.9: Tesla – The Volatility Monster
**(Case Study: Statistical Probability & Valuation Extremes)**

1.  **Price-to-FCF 247.4x:** Astronomically overvalued. V15 shows a downside potential of **-46.6%** to reach Fair Value ($219).
2.  **Prob. Entry 10.44%:** The chance of a new high in 5 days is tiny. V15 advises against "lottery ticket" buys.
3.  **Trend Divergence:** Daily is BEARISH, Weekly is BULLISH. No entry until both align.

---

### 📈 Subsection 10.10: Apple – The Market Anchor
**(Case Study: Relative Strength & Fundamental Saturation)**

1.  **The Fortress:** $117 Billion GAAP Profit. Grade B because growth is slow (+1.4%).
2.  **Relative Strength (RS):** Even though technicals are bearish, Apple is **STRONGER** than the world market. It is the last thing investors sell.
3.  **Neutral Verdict:** Apple is a "Hold." It's an anchor, but without revenue growth, there is no massive outperformance.

---

## 11. Practical Guide & Psychology

### Perfect Setup Workflow
1.  **Sector Check:** Sector green (Favored)?
2.  **Fundamental Check:** Grade A/B, Warnings < 2?
3.  **Technical Check:** Weekly Trend Bullish, price above SMA 50?
4.  **Signal:** Green "ENTRY" label?
5.  **RR Check:** Risk-to-Reward ratio > 2?

### Psychology: Defeating Greed
If a stock reaches the **BULL TARGET** (top green line), the dashboard often switches to "Overvalued." Professionals take partial profits; amateurs buy more. V15 objectively warns against euphoria.

**Pro Tip:** Secure profits, do not buy more out of greed.

---

## Conclusion
**Strategic Fundamental Analysis & Algorithmic Market Engineering V15** is a mathematical bulwark against poor decisions. Think like an institutional investor: Risk first (Warnings, Debt, Sector), then opportunity (Growth, Trend, Probability).

**Never trade blindly on signals – use the dashboard to understand the story behind the chart!**
